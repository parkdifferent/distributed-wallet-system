Architecture Design Compliance Analysis
Compliance Evaluation
1. CQRS with Event Sourcing Pattern ✅

The system correctly implements CQRS by separating command and query responsibilities:

wallet-command: Handles write operations
wallet-query: Handles read operations
Event sourcing is implemented through Kafka events (wallet-events topic)



2. Query Side Implementation ✅

The current AccountEventConsumer follows the documented query side architecture by:

Consuming events from Kafka (as shown in the @KafkaListener annotation)
Maintaining materialized views through AccountEntity
Handling different types of events (AccountCreated, BalanceChanged, etc.)
Providing query capabilities through AccountQueryService



3. Event Handling ✅

The implementation handles various events as documented:

Account management operations (Create/Delete/Lock/Unlock)
Balance operations (through BalanceChangedEvent)
Event versioning for Read-Your-Write consistency



4. Fault Tolerance ✅

The implementation shows fault tolerance features:

Using Kafka for reliable event delivery
Transactional processing (@Transactional)
Stateless query service that can rebuild state from events



Areas for Improvement
1. Performance Optimization ⚠️

The documentation mentions "P99 < 20ms when TPS = 10K", but the current implementation might need performance tuning:

Consider batch processing of events
Implement caching strategies
Optimize database operations



2. Missing Features ⚠️

Account hierarchy support (marked as TBD in docs)
Multi-asset class support implementation details
OLAP integration for complex analytical queries

3. Monitoring ⚠️

The documentation mentions Prometheus metrics, but I don't see the metrics implementation in the current codebase

Recommendations

Add metrics collection for monitoring query side performance
Implement caching to achieve the documented performance targets
Consider implementing the account hierarchy feature
Add support for multi-asset class operations
Implement OLAP integration for analytical queries

Conclusion
The current implementation largely follows the core architectural principles outlined in the documentation, particularly the CQRS with Event Sourcing pattern and fault tolerance design. However, there are opportunities to enhance the implementation to fully realize all documented features and performance characteristics.
